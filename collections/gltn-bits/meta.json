  "description": "GLTN BITS is a collection of 1,000 handmade 1/1 abstract ordinals inscribed one-at-a-time on the Bitcoin blockchain. The goal of GLTN BITS is to create immutable numismatic value to satoshis via creativity and color. Each ordinal is created by a naturally generative process, captured digitally, separated and arranged into a unique and interesting new creation, then reduced to a raw pixelated form. Current release: 1-36 of 1000",
